# safety-rm
*Everybody know rm could be little dangerous to use,if u rm some unbackup or something by mistake,u can't just bring it back on a easy way,especially when u rm lots of file.*
###And i know there is much sh to prevent it.BUT THIS IS MY PROJECt,so i use the lua not bash.
##SRM IN LUA
  it use lua as save list,u can read list or search it to know when and where u rm your file.And u can bring it back by a easy way.
